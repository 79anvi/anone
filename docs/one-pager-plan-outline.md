# Anone engineering plan outline

# Phases outline
1. __Testnet 1__: super safe basic functional chain
* __WHY?__: the tasks in this phase are very familiar with the team. We can still ICO on schedule in case test - net 2 fails to meet deadline.
* __GOAL__: basic functionalities on cosmos eco-system
    * integrate one to keplr wallet.

    * add airdrop for one1 address
    * custom configuration

2. __Testnet 2__: etherum and NFT integration
* __WHY?__: this phase is for adding and testing new features
* __GENERAL GOAL__: this chain version must resemble real mainnet
* __ETHERUM GOAL__: add support for etherum
    * implement support for handling tx signed by metamask
    * prepare an uniform https JSON-RPC endpoint
    * add airdrop testing for eth-format address
